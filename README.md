# 2ndtestproject
Hey my name is Shirbu on here.
I am a beginner who just started using Github not too long ago. I am trying to learn how to use github, git, visual studio code and some other languages and I am also learning
to use code in Unity! This is my 2nd test project which is what I have been using to commit my first ever changes and for me to remember how to use the code shortcuts for adding
things to the repository.
